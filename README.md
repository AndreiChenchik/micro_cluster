Outline:
- Terraform Cloud for git-connected orchestration with state-keeping (FREE of charge)
- Google Kubernetes Engine for Docker contrainers (master node FREE of charge)
- DockerHub to build & store container images (FREE of charge)
- Google Compute Engine for cloud computations (hourly paid depending on your needs)

Todo: 
- Detach container instructions as separate terraform module
